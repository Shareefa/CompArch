# Structures in Memary

### Alignment Requirements

Depending on what OS there are different ways the data is stored at the memory level

Some notes on

**Basic Take Away**: Use sizeof() because there is like padding

# Cache Unit

### Memory

Modeled as:
* Linear array of bytes

Reality:
* Many different types of Memory
* Different speeds and different sizes

**Memory = RAM**

Static RAM:
* Pure transistor circuit(6 transistor circuit)
* Faster than DRAM
* higher cost

Dynamic RAM:
* Capacitor and transistor
* Need to be refreshed
* Slower than SRAM
*
